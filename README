A simple flask app written to help non-native English speakers translate a word in a native language to a synonym in a target language.

### Prerequisites

You will need both a Websters Dictionary API key as well as a Google Translate API key for this app.

### Installing

```
virutalenv flask
cd flask
. venv/bin/activate
pip install flask requests
```

This should result in a directory structure that looks like:

```
/<app_name>
/<app_name>/app
/<app_name>/app/static
/<app_name>/app/templates
/<app_name>/flask
```

## Built With

* [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) - Web App Framework
* [Webster Dictionary API](https://www.dictionaryapi.com/) - Used to find source word synonyms
* [Google Cloud Translation API](https://cloud.google.com/translate/) - Used to translate synonyms to target language
